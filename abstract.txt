Nuclei detection and segmentation in digital microscopic tissue images has been a long standing challenge in the field of histology as well as computer vision. While there have been many attempts to solve this problem, especially using recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning, such methods pose a fundamental problem of lack of enough properly annotated data. Hence, we shift the focus to non-machine learning methods in computer vision to address this issue. We investigate two non-machine learning methods ( Hough circle detection and Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher segmentation) and two machine learning methods ( Mask R-CNNs and UNets) for nuclei segmentation. While our main focus is on non-machine learning methods, we use machine learning methods to create baselines for our experiments. The models are compared using mean IOU scores over the dataset.
