# U-Net-Nuclei-Detector

This is code for a Nuclei Detector that used a U-net neural network.


You do not need much to run this code. You will just need to have a few modules downloaded, like tensorflow, tqdm, scikit-image, and keras. Along with this, you will need to download the data yourself because it was too large to be uploaded. The images can be found here:

If they are put in the same directory as this, then the program unet.py will work. Just run python unet.py! 
The code will iterate through the images, run them through some preprocessing, then define a network and run the data through it. Unfortunately, this takes quite a bit of time, so instead Iâ€™ve included the model of a network already trained using it. So instead of training an entire network, you can just see how it preforms on new data. It will take five random images from the test data and attempt to segment them. They are then shown one after the other so that you can compare them to each other.
